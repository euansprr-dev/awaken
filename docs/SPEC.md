# AWAKEN — Implementation Spec (v1)

This is the source of truth for builders. The player-facing design and its reasoning live in `docs/plan.html`.
When this spec and the plan disagree, this spec wins. When something is unspecified, pick the simplest
behaviour that serves the five pillars and write it down here in the same commit.

Pillars (every feature must serve two): **Main character energy · Pulled, not pushed · Every door is different ·
Learn by touching · Awareness is power.**

Hard rules:
- Nothing runs on real-world time. Timers count **play-days** (in-game days that pass while at least one player is online).
- Never more than **3** active Directives. Never a quest list. Undiscovered things are never listed.
- A reward is granted at most once per claim id. Loot moves, it is never copied.
- **Patent rule:** something done to one hostile NPC never changes a *different* hostile NPC's stats.
  Consequences go into world state (gate rank, blight, timers, loot, spawn budgets). The Rival is authored and advances on
  the player's rank milestones only. Nightmares are chosen from authored templates by the player's own death counts.
- No language model, no network calls. Everything local and deterministic (seeded).
- Performance: p50 ≥ 110 fps in a full gate fight on an M4; server tick p95 ≤ 25 ms; ≤ 60 active combat entities;
  ≤ 3 ms/tick of main-thread work for any background job.

Rules for builders:
- Touch only your module's package, your module's resources (namespaced file names), and your merge folder
  `src/main/merge/<module>/`. Shared JSON (lang, sounds.json, tags) is **merged at build time** from those folders.
- Each module has `XxxModule.init(IEventBus modBus)` (called from `Awaken`) and optionally `XxxClient.init(IEventBus)`.
  Register your own DeferredRegisters, payloads (own `RegisterPayloadHandlersEvent` listener), attachments, commands
  (as `/awaken <module> ...` subcommands via `AwakenCommands.register(...)`), and GameTests.
- Cross-module calls go through the small public API classes listed in §12. Never reach into another module's internals.
- Verify every Minecraft/NeoForge API against `/Volumes/MEDIA/Awaken/.ref` and `docs/api/*.md`. 26.3 differs from 1.21.1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Numbers (from `tools/sim/pacing_sim.py`, tuned 2026-10-23)

```
xpToNext(L)      = 90 * L^1.45 + 60
RANKS            = E, D, C, B, A, S, SOVEREIGN          (index 0..6)
RANK_LEVEL       = D 10, C 25, B 45, A 70, S 100, SOVEREIGN 135   (level needed to take the Reassessment)
RANK_MID         = E 5, D 17, C 35, B 57, A 85, S 118, SOVEREIGN 150  (gate content level)
SHARE            = E .81, D .39, C .25, B .23, A .18, S .12, SOVEREIGN .12
floorReward(r,f) = SHARE[r] * xpToNext(RANK_MID[r]) * 1.4^(f-1)
   40% arrives as kill XP during the floor (split across the floor's spawned mobs)
   60% is the floor bonus, carried as "Satchel XP" and banked only on extraction or boss kill
gate below your rank pays x0.3
home activity XP ~ 1.2% of a level per active minute (capped per minute; see §4.3)
Daily Regimen    = 0.25 * xpToNext(L) + 1 stat point
death            = lose Satchel (items + Satchel XP), keep gear & kill XP, gain Insight, Fracture 8 min (Hunter mode)
story length     = config multiplier on all XP: 2.0 (≈50 h), 1.0 (≈100 h, default), 0.67 (≈150 h)
```

Gate shape: floors = min(6, 3 + rank/2 + coin). Breaks in = max(1, 4 - rank/2 + (0|1)) play-days.
Modifier budget by gate rank E..S: 1,2,3,4,5,6; max count 1,1,2,2,3,3; Sovereign = S.
Twist: 1/8 chance, guaranteed on the 12th gate without one (per player).
Director gate rank roll: 70% player rank, 20% one below, 10% one above. Keep 1–4 open gates within 300–1500 blocks of each
online player. No theme from the player's last 3 gates, no layout from the last 2.

Second reward rhythm: the Director tracks minutes since the player's last *new thing* (new power, title, Truth true,
latent, depth record, trophy, scanned machine). After 20 min it biases: next elite drop → Power Core (+50%),
next Directive → one that completes quickly. Power Core pity: guaranteed from a Gate Lord if none in the last 3 bosses.

Mob scaling by content level `lv` (RANK_MID of the gate/stratum):
```
health = base * (1 + 0.075*lv)       damage = base * (1 + 0.04*lv)       armor += lv/12
```
Player scaling (stats, §3) and gate gear tiers keep an on-level player at roughly 3–6 hits per normal mob.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Stats

Six stats, start at **5** each at awakening. **+3 points per level**, +1 per completed Regimen, some Truths give points.
Respec: Precursor "Recalibrator" machine (above), costs essence.

| Stat | Effect (per point unless noted) | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| STR | +2.5% melee damage; Kinetic power scaling | ATTACK_DAMAGE multiply_base modifier `awaken:stat_str` |
| AGI | +0.4% move speed (cap +40%), +1% attack speed (cap +60%); Flow +0.05 s | MOVEMENT_SPEED / ATTACK_SPEED modifiers |
| VIT | +0.6 max health; +0.5% damage resistance (cap 35%) | MAX_HEALTH add_value; resistance in damage event |
| INT | energy pool 100 + 5/pt; Energy/Tech power damage +1.5% | read by powers |
| PER | crit chance 0.4% (cap 35%, crits ×1.6); secret glow radius 4 + PER/4 blocks; omen detail tiers at 20/40/60 | damage event + clients |
| SPI | cord length 32 + 6/pt (cap 1024); Veil time 30 s + 3 s/pt; lucidity gain +1%; Echo cap 3 + SPI/6 | read by veil/lucidium/hearth |

Energy regen: 4/s + 0.08 × INT per second, paused for 1 s after spending.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Progression

### 4.1 Profile attachment (`progression`, synced to owner, copyOnDeath)
`level, xp, rank, unspent, stats[6], awakened(bool), path(id|null), truthsDeclared(≤3), truthsTrue(set), titles(set),
equippedTitle, latents(set), counters(map<id,long>), directives(≤3), regimen(today), lastNewThingTick, insight(map),
fractureUntil, playDay, schemaVersion`.

### 4.2 Counters
Any module calls `Progression.count(player, "awaken:<name>", amount)`. Counters drive Truths, Titles, Latents, Paths,
Directives and Regimen. Standard counter ids are listed in `progression/Counters.java`; modules add their own ids freely.

### 4.3 Home XP
Kills of overworld hostiles: 4% of a level × mob max health/20 (cap 1 level per 10 min from kills). Mining ores: 1% of a
level per ore (cap). Placing blocks: 0.05% per block (cap 1% per minute). Hard cap: 1.5% of a level per real minute
from home activity.

### 4.4 Reassessment (rank-up)
At RANK_LEVEL the Spine says "Reassessment available". Trial is taken at the Spire (hearth town) or any Reassessment
Monolith. Trials are handcrafted arenas (in the Stillpoint dimension's trial wing): D survive 3 waves; C Second Awakening
(waves + Path reveal); B boss duel; A timed descent (5 rooms, 4 min); S fight a Sovereign's echo; SOVEREIGN after the Seed.
Pass → rank++, Signal Reassessment window, town celebration, new tier of gates, aura tier.

### 4.5 Truths
Data: `data/awaken/awaken/truth/*.json` `{id, text, hint?, condition, reward}`. Offered 3 at awakening and 3 at each rank
(plus emergent ones when a hidden condition is met). Declare up to 3 → "NOT TRUE YET" → condition met → TRUE (permanent).
Conditions (`progression/Condition`): `counter_at_least`, `streak_at_least` (counter that resets on a reset-counter),
`event` (one-shot flag), `all/any`.

### 4.6 Titles & Latents
Same condition system. Titles: equip one (perk). Latents: hidden, granted automatically, announced by a Notice, recorded in
the Codex only once found. Codex shows counts like `Latents 7 / ??`.

### 4.7 Paths (Second Awakening, C-rank)
12 paths; 6 at launch + 3 later + 3 hidden. Each has `scoring` (weighted counters normalised per hour) and `hidden`
condition for hidden ones. Offer top 3 + qualifying hidden. Evidence lines quote real counters. Pick grants a signature
power + passive + aura colour.

### 4.8 Directives
Rule tables in data `directive/*.json` with `when` (context filters), `text`, `condition`, `reward`, `expires_days`.
One new offer per morning or notable event, max 3 active, no repeats within 5 play-days, ≥1 in 4 must be "fresh".
Accept with Y, ignore and it fades.

### 4.9 Daily Regimen
Each in-game morning: 3 drills tuned to Path (sprint distance, Flow seconds, kills, Training Grounds lap, meditate 30 s,
mine N). Reward per §2. Skip = nothing, unless Hardline (Penalty Zone: survive 4 min in a desert night arena).

### 4.10 Director
Runs every 1000 ticks per online player: gates upkeep, directive offers, new-thing rhythm, break warnings.
`/awaken why` prints the last 10 decisions with inputs. Novelty memory stored per player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Signal (UI)

Server: `Signal.send(ServerPlayer, SignalWindow)`. `SignalWindow{kind, title, body?, rows[(label,value)], footer?,
actions[(id,label)], ttlTicks, priority}`; kinds NOTICE, GATE, DIRECTIVE, TRUTH, WARNING, REASSESSMENT, REVELATION, DAYS_END.
Client: one window at a time, top-centre glass panel, letters type in fast, chime. In combat (hurt in last 5 s or hostile
within 8 blocks) windows become a compact toast and queue. Actions answered with **Y** (accept) / **N** (dismiss).
Visual: deep glass `#0F1724` at 88% alpha, edge `#7FC3FF`, corner brackets, title white, labels pale, "NOT TRUE YET" amber
`#FFCF7A`, warnings `#FF8A7A`.

Status screen (key **K**): tabs Status · Truths · Codex · Gate Map. Status shows level, rank, path, title, stats with
+ buttons when points unspent, energy, Echoes, the Spine line, active Directives, and the power loadout section
(provided by `powers` via `StatusSections`).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Powers

Slots: 4 active (Z X C V), Ultimate (R), Movement (Left Alt). Passive powers apply when owned.
`PowerType` registry (custom registry `awaken:power_type`) with code; data numbers in the same class.
Families: Kinetic, Velocity, Flight, Energy, Shadow, Mind, Architect, Tech, Spirit. Forces: HEAT, CHARGE, GRAVITY, SPIRIT,
FROST (+ SPORES, WATER, VOLATILE, MIRROR as environmental tags).
Power Cores: item `awaken:power_core` with component `{power, variant}`. Using it learns the power (or upgrades a known one).
Movement powers are client-predicted (velocity applied locally, server validates and corrects).
Feel: hit-stop 40–80 ms on heavy hits (client time scale on the hit entity's render + camera kick), shake toggle in config.

Launch power list (≥45): see `powers/PowerCatalog.java` header for the authoritative list with numbers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Gates

Overworld: `awaken:gate` block structure (frame + core) at a surface position; client renders a light pillar coloured by
rank (E #F4F6FB, D #5FD08F, C #6FB3FF, B #B48CFF, A #F2A541, S #FF5A6A, Sovereign black-gold), visible up to 1500 blocks
(drawn at clamped distance beyond render distance).
Gate card shows rank, breaks-in, omen; PER ≥20 adds layout, ≥40 modifiers, ≥60 floor count; Veil scouting shows all.

Dimension `awaken:gates`: cells of 512×512 aligned to region files, cell origin = ((i mod 64)·1024, (i div 64)·1024).
Floors stacked vertically: floor f at y = 200 − 32·(f−1) (f = 1..6), each floor a grid of room slots (16-block pitch).
Generation is deterministic from `GatePlan{seed, theme, layout, modifiers, twist, floors, boss, contentVersion}`.
Rooms: start, normal, elite, cache, puzzle (some layouts), shrine (floor end), boss arena (last floor).
Everything picked up inside a gate goes to the **Satchel** (27 slots + Satchel XP). Shrine: Extract (bank + return to
gate mouth) or continue via the Seal to the next floor. Boss kill: claim + exit portal.
Gate pressure: after 4 min on a floor, a wave every 45 s, scaling; at 8 min the gate's Warden (elite) arrives.
States: BUILDING → READY → ACTIVE ⇄ OPEN → CLEARED | BROKEN → RELEASED (cell region files deleted on server stop).
Break: spill wave + roaming Gate Lord with boss bar at the gate; blight (desaturation + grey fog) within 96 blocks until
cleared; better loot. Warning one play-day ahead when within 256 blocks of a Hearth.

Themes (15), layouts (8), modifiers (14), twists (8), bosses: exactly as in `docs/plan.html` gate generator.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. The Descent

The Well: landmark structure within 400–700 blocks of world spawn (a Precursor ring around a deep shaft). Jumping in (or the
Well's lift) enters stratum 1. Strata = dimensions `awaken:stratum_1` … `awaken:stratum_10`, each its own generator +
biome + one rule; drops (portal pits) lead to the next. Endless = `awaken:endless` (cells, stacking rules).
Rules: 1 none · 2 wind gusts · 3 rising water every 5 min · 4 the dead rise once · 5 sound draws Listeners ·
6 machines wake (power puzzles) · 7 gravity flips with the tides · 8 rooms change when unobserved · 9 your shadow fights you ·
10 the Seed (finale). Waystone per stratum: checkpoint + fast travel. Strain when climbing up without the Deep Lift:
−(5% × strata climbed) to all stats for 10 min, stacking. Grave Echo on death in the Descent holds the Satchel.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Lucidium, Veil, Stillpoint

Lucidium: Day Journal captures ≤10 snapshots/day (≤64 kept) as structure templates ≤16×12×16 around salient events. At
dusk a DreamPlan is built; on sleep (dream chance 40% + SPI%, +bed/Sanctuary) the player enters a Lucidium cell for 3–8
min. Lucidity 0–100: reality check (H) +12 in dreams, dream sign spotted +15, intention set at bed +10 start, WBTB
(alarm block wakes you, sleep again within 1 in-game hour) +25 start, Recall stat (journal entries) +0.5/entry.
≥50 lucid: flight, intent-manifest (hold H on a wall: door/stair/bridge from snapshot palette). ≥80 summon from memory.
Dying in a dream: wake "Shaken" (no penalty). Not ready → normal sleep. Hold sneak while sleeping: dreamless.

Veil: sneak + G held 10 s, still, not in combat → Body (mannequin-like entity with skin + gear, chunk ticket) +
player switched to spectator-backed spirit mode with cord radius (SPI). Awareness fog radius = PER/SPI derived. Ores and
secrets glow within Awareness (client-only highlight, server-sent positions). Only blue-tagged `veil_interactable` things
can be used. Body hit → Warning + snap back offered; body killed → player killed. Logout → snap back first.
Stillpoint dimension `awaken:stillpoint`: void + cloud sea + dawn temple platform; time ×10 slower feel (no hunger, no
mobs). Hub for stats, Truths, Codex; doors Out (Veil) and In (Lucidium, only while asleep). Hosts trial arenas.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Above, Hearth, Story

Above: Precursor Vaults/sky platforms/ocean labs/monoliths; Scanner reads broken machines → Codex blueprint; machines
built at home from 3–5 parts; Essence power from a reactor within 32 blocks. Machines: Gate Scanner, Gate Stabiliser,
Waypoint Pylon, Deep Lift, Frame Forge, Clone Vat, Dream Recorder, Signal Relay, Recalibrator, Observatory, Launch Ring.
Halo dimension `awaken:halo`: orbital station, low gravity, archive with the truth.

Hearth: Anchor block (crafted from first boss essence) defines a 48-block radius base. Rooms detected by contents:
Sanctuary (bed + meditation mat), Armory (anvil + forge + rack), Trophy Hall (≥1 trophy), Workshop (≥1 machine),
Barracks (role pads). Town NPCs arrive by rank: Blacksmith (E), Scout (D), Archivist (C), Healer (B), Rival (A).
Echoes: bind fallen elites/bosses (B key within 10 s, chance by SPI and rank), cap by SPI, roles at home via role pads
(Guard, Haul, Farm, Mine, Train). Costs of Hearth upgrades fall 15% per rank above the upgrade's tier.

Story: prologue (scripted Bell Crypt → death → Stillpoint "Will you accept?" → Accept/Accept), Acts I–III gated by rank,
Revelations via Signal, Codex rumour board, the Rival's beats at D/C/B/A/S, endings at the Seed (Become / Break / Wake),
then New Game+ "Ascension" tiers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. Config (`awaken-common.toml` / server)

difficulty: STORY | HUNTER (default) | HARDLINE | HARDCORE · storyLength: 0.5 | 1.0 | 1.5 · features: gates, descent,
lucidium, veil, above, hearth, story (bools) · cameraShake · signalTypeSpeed · playtestMode (off).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 12. Cross-module public API (stable)

- `dev.awaken.signal.Signal` — `send(ServerPlayer, SignalWindow)`, `toast(ServerPlayer, Component)`.
- `dev.awaken.progression.Progression` — `profile(Player)`, `grantXp(ServerPlayer, double, XpSource)`, `count(ServerPlayer,
  Identifier, long)`, `markNewThing(ServerPlayer, String what)`, `rank(Player)`, `stat(Player, Stat)`, `contentLevel(rank)`.
- `dev.awaken.powers.Powers` — `learn(ServerPlayer, Identifier power, int variant)`, `energy(Player)`, `forcesOf(DamageSource)`.
- `dev.awaken.gates.Gates` — `gateAt(...)`, `activeRun(ServerPlayer)`, `isInGate(Entity)`, `satchelAdd(...)`, `preview(id)`.
- `dev.awaken.core.Forces` — force/environment tags on entities and damage.
- `dev.awaken.core.PlayDays` — current play-day counter.
- `dev.awaken.mobs.Mobs` — `spawnScaled(ServerLevel, EntityType, pos, level, modifiers)`, rosters by theme.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 13. Decisions made while building (details in docs/modules/*.md)

Descent:
- Strata open by rank: 1 E · 2–3 D · 4–5 C · 6–7 B · 8 A · 9 S · 10 (the Seed) S-rank at level 135 **and** all eight
  Sovereigns of the Hollow Court defeated (story gate via `StoryHooks.seedSealed`). The Endless opens after the Seed.
- Stratum content level = content level of rank index min(6, (n+1)/2): stratum 1 already plays at D (17).
- STORY-mode deaths in the Descent keep half the Deep Pack at once; the other half waits in a Grave Echo.
- Waystone travel *upward* costs Strain; only the Deep Lift climbs for free.

Mobs:
- 154 creatures; vanilla models re-tinted (vanilla textures referenced, never copied) plus 5 custom models.
- Scaling: normals ×1, elites ×2.5, wardens ×5, bosses ×14 health (bosses ×1.6 damage); nightmares ×6 health / ×1.25
  damage; Sovereigns ×1.5 and the Signal's Shadow ×2 on top of boss scaling. All scaling uses permanent modifiers.
- Boss phase changes knock one boss part loose (once per boss). Essence per kill scales with content tier.
- `bosses_killed` and `bosses_killed_unarmed` are counted by mobs (not gates).

Story:
- The Hollow Court spawns the next undefeated Sovereign (fixed order: Hunger, Silence, Sleep, Machines, Mirrors,
  Storms, Roots, Ash) near an S-rank player in stratum 9 when none is alive nearby; in the Seed the story starts the
  finale (`Descent.beginFinale`), and the chosen ending calls `Descent.completeSeed`.
